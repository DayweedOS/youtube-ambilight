- This extension only runs on tabs that start with the url https://www.youtube.com. The extension will only activate the ambient light effect on YouTube's /watch page
- The only requests being sent are crash reports. (But crash reports can be turned off.) No other requests are sent to any webserver, website or api. But in case a crash occurs the report is sent to [Sentri.io](https://sentry.io) and will always be deleted after 30 days. Because the only goal of these crash reports is to fix the crash.
