1. Combine downsizing in canvas-webgl into projector-webgl (implement draw pipeline)
2. Implement new draw pipeline in with canvas2dbuffers into projector-2d
3. Retrieve canvas pixels from projector in webgl and 2d mode (is 256x256 enough?)
4. Implement frameblending in webgl and 2d
5. Implement webgl getPixel in bar detection (also determined by the webgl setting)
