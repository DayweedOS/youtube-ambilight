This extension will surround YouTube videos with ambilight inside your browser. No need for extra hardware like lightstrips or smart lights, it's all in your browser!
And it works on both the classic and new YouTube layout.


Requirement:

A video card with a score of at least 5000 points in the PassMark G3D Mark benchmark is recommended.
Check your video card's score here: https://www.videocardbenchmark.net/gpu_list.php
With a score lower than 5000 the extension will still work but it is likely that the YouTube video page will be slow and/or stuttering.
