This extension will surround YouTube videos with ambilight inside your browser. No need for extra hardware like lightstrips or smart lights, it's all in your browser!
And it works on both the classic and new YouTube layout.


Requirement:

A video card with a score of at least 5000 points in the PassMark Video Card Benchmark is recommended.
Check your video card's score here: https://www.videocardbenchmark.net/gpu_list.php
With a score lower than 5000 the extension will still work but it is likely that the YouTube video page will be slow and/or stuttering.


Features:

1. Ambilight control
- Blur
- Spread
- Edge size
- Fade out start & curve
- Directions (top, left, bottom, right)

2. Ambilight image adjustment
- Brightness
- Contrast
- Saturation

3. Video
- Auto-detect & remove black bars
- Reset black bars in the next video
- Scale
- Shadow size & opacity

4. Videopage content
- Shadow size & opacity
- Immersive mode (Show only the video when you are at the top of the page)

5. Ambilight quality & performance
- Debanding (dithering)
- Prevent frame drops: Syncs the ambilight effect with the video framerate more tightly. This will require extra CPU usage because it detects new video frames on every display refresh rate, since the native framerate counter of the browser can be delayed.
- Sync video exactly 
- Smooth motion (frame blending)

6. General
- Show framerate
- Dark theme on videopage only
- Enable in fullscreen: Shows the surround ambilight in fullscreen mode where normally black bars are located
- Enabled/Disabled
